A key based locking system (normal and double chests) for Minecraft.

Just copy the HumaniyLock.jar into your plugins folder.

prerequisites:
Bukkit.


How to use:
Just spawn a chest and you'll recieve a written book.
The written book is the key to that chest.

The coordinates of the chest are displayed in the lore of the book.
To change the name of the book:
Hold the book in your hand and type "/key <name>".

Note that with double chests you won't recieve another key, 
but the original key / chest can only be accessed.


When your inventory is full, the key will be dropped on the ground.
